# Machine-Learning-Capstone
This is the concluding project for my Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. It will use Deep Learning to classify medical images.


## What is needed for the Web-App?
Nothing.
The purpose of my project will be to implement a Web application that will allow you to upload downloaded images yourself from your local machine.

## What is needed for you to download the data for AWS notebook?
Everything is automized for you for the most part. However you need your kaggle.json file that provides you authentification to use their API. Read the *Authentication* section of the documentation <a href=https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api>here</a>. You must upload your kaggle.json file into the root of your AWS SageMaker instance. Then everything will work fine!

## Dataset and Explanation
Please read my Machine Learning Capstone Proposal.pdf file that is included in this repo. It should contain all the information that you would like to know.


## Currently Working On
At this moment I am just preparing my PyTorch models to be trained using AWS SageMaker.
