# Machine-Learning-Capstone
This is the concluding project for my Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. It will use Deep Learning to classify medical images.


## What is needed?
Nothing.
The purpose of my project will be to implement a Web application that will allow you to upload downloaded images yourself from your local machine.

## Dataset and Explanation
Please read my Machine Learning Capstone Proposal.pdf file that is included in this repo. It should contain all the information that you would like to know.
